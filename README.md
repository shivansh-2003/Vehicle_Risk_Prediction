### Overview
The Vehicle Risk Prediction application is designed to predict the risk associated with driving a vehicle based on various factors such as weather conditions, road hazards, visibility, traffic density, and driver-related factors like fatigue level, speeding, and medical conditions. The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on historical data to provide risk predictions.



### Setup Virtual Environment### Goal üéØ
'The aim is to create a web app for the Vehicle Live Risk Prediction project. Use the best existing model in the project folder. Follow the Web App README template for the same.'

### Model(s) used for the Web App 
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and widely-used machine learning algorithm known for its efficiency and effectiveness in predictive modeling tasks. It belongs to the ensemble learning methods, specifically boosting algorithms, and has gained popularity for its exceptional performance in various machine learning competitions and real-world applications.
### Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Python and pip installed on your system.
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
```
python -m venv myenv
  ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

#### Install Requirements
 While the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using pip:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
#### Run the Application
 After installing the requirements, run the Streamlit application using the following command:
 ```
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
